# Trading-Exchange
The objective of this project is to build a Level 2 crytpo currency trading platform using the GDAX trading toolkit GTT which comes bundled with a CLI utility that lets you make API calls to supported exchanges with a unified interface and set of commands and APIs.  I am working with a bank that is building APIs into the largest exchanges including GDAX which will allow institutional account formation and trading capabilities from one command and control  center using level 2 trading functionality currently being used on equity trading exchanges like the NYSE/OTC etc.
